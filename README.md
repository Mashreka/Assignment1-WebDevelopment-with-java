# Web Programming Mini-Project: Tomcat, Servlets, and MySQL

This repository contains my implementation of a mini-project focused on learning the fundamentals of web programming using Tomcat, Servlets, and MySQL. The project involves creating a dynamic HTML website with navigation links that are mapped to Servlets on the server. When users click on these links, data is retrieved from a MySQL database and displayed in HTML format.

## Project Objectives:
- Create an HTML website with basic styling and navigation links.
- Set up a MySQL database named "gritAcademy" using phpMyAdmin.
- Design three tables: "students," "courses," and an "attendance" table for student-course relationships.
- Implement Servlets to handle GET requests and generate dynamic HTML content.
- Ensure proper mapping of Servlets to URLs and establish inter-Servlet navigation links.

## Technologies Used:
- **Apache Tomcat**: for hosting Servlets.
- **MySQL**: for database management.
- **HTML and CSS**: for frontend design and styling.
- **Java Servlets**: for server-side processing and dynamic content generation.
